I have decided to make this blog a draft indefinitely to minimize it's publicity. I leave the reasoning behind this as something for the reader to infer from the title and content of the article.

# Some people think I'm broadly competent

This is mostly an online phenomenon (it may be just one person) and I don't know where this comes from but it also seems to filter into how old they think I am (leading to an overestimation of somewhere between a couple and several years). Regardless this is false though I will clarify that in terms of math and programming I am relatively competent. I chose those words carefully to reduce the probability of my ego crucifying me, notably I consider relatively competent a low bar.

# Writing

Read my blog posts and tell me I'm competent at writing while keeping a straight face.

# Time management

Time management has been something I've struggled with for some years now. Frankly the fact that my grades in college are decent is a miracle (I had such a close shave with my econ class though lmao). I spend way to much time on youtube and I'm not sure how to deal with that to be honest. Regardless I'm at least in a state where things are better at the moment but who knows how long that will last.

# Presentations

Okay so the reason I'm putting this is because the person who's comment induced this writing readily accepted my advice on a presentation for unknown reasons. But seriously when making a presentation all I do is just have the bullet points be maximally short sentence fragments and trust in the speaker to be competent at speaking. Longer bullets make the speaker redundant, animations are distracting and you'll know when you need an image (assignments which mandate a minimum amount of images suck).

# Misc life things

Need to talk to people more, my diet sucks, I don't have a partner and no idea how I'd change that if it becomes a higher priority, I need to get better at not accidentally taking the lead in group work, I don't have an internship and no idea how to get one or how I should get a job. I have a bunch of stories I've come up with that I want to write down but I haven't written yet. I have no idea how to make a machine learning thing.

# Conclusion

Scot why do you think I look competent if it's confidence please readjust your view of competence
