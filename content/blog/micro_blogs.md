# You know the drill

Same deal as the [speedrun blog](https://pagwin.xyz/blog/speedrun/) putting down a bunch of ideas that I want out of my head but aren't worthy of a full blog.

## The entire set plus one more in the set

Let me start off where I started off<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> lets say that someone who we shall name Steve anonymously puts a bounty on themselves which is described as "$1 in addition to whatever money Steve has on their person" how much money should be payed out to whoever collects the bounty on Steve and where would it come from? Well in this case the way that reality works and the set of actors involved constrains us to the answer of "whatever money Steve has on their person" and no more. This answer would correspond to addition being equivalent to the set union operator. That does work but with slightly different context it seems like the answer would be different, for example pretend that a god came down and said "I am going to transfer ten humans in addition to the entire human population to a habitable planet in a different galaxy". In this case specifying ten humans in addition implies that we're transferring a number of humans greater than just the current human population but also ten more because otherwise why specify those ten humans. The problem that I have is how many humans come out on the other side. "Why not just the current population plus ten?" well because transfer implies they already exist and aren't being created in that moment so the number should be the same and also my brain thinks there's an interpretation or slightly different wording where you could argue there'll be infinitely many humans. I'm pretty sure this is a [type 5 paradox](https://youtu.be/ppX7Qjbe6BM?t=2035)

## Excel with types/static analysis?

So I think I started thinking about this when I rewatched [this Matt Parker video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2zkxHDfUE). I'm wondering if there's a niche for some spreadsheet software is intended to require the user to specify types for cells or a full sql-esque table or something in addition to doing some nice lints/static analysis like you would see in software to minimize errors. My mind has also feature creeped this idea out a bit to have this program capable of exporting some file package/sql database and an executable so you can have something maintaining the structure of the data while other programs do automated stuff in the hopes that Ludicity doesn't come in for a [drop kick](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-dropkick-you-if-you-use-that-spreadsheet/).


## PSA please check to make sure browser zoom works okay on your site <sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>

And also phones and screen readers but the browser zoom one is the one that affected me when I'm writing this (over 2 months after the prior 2 sections). Particularly if you have a blog with some text content that's centered with whitespace as the margins and I zoom in I don't just want to see the text get bigger I also want the margins to shrink so the text has more room. Reason being so zooming isn't proportional to additional scrolling. Thanks.

## Wait mobile vs desktop is just handled via a CSS if statement?

I was exploring the CSS to understand how the margins shrank for my site but not the offending site and I noticed on both sites that the css styling jumped a bit as I shrank and grew the page width only to realize the reason was because of some [CSS if statement(s)](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/). I don't know why I previously thought you could deal with this in some other way but TIL.


## How long should I make these?

I've never thought about this before but how long should I make blogs? How long should I make microblog dumps? I don't know I should probably think about that... later I will think about that later.

## Footnotes

<a href="./#1" name="1">1</a> - I started off in a fan-fic of the stormlight archive where a character I inserted into the story was putting up a bounty for themselves by promising "a shardblade in addition to any shardblades or shardplate $character has on them" rather than with money
<a href="./#2" name="2">2</a> - If you noticed that the blog example was specific that's because this post was incited by a blog with whitespace which didn't shrink the whitespace when I zoomed. Also at time of writing I checked to make sure my site adheres to this.
