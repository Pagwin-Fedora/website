# You know the drill

Same deal as the [speedrun blog](https://pagwin.xyz/blog/speedrun/) putting down a bunch of ideas that I want out of my head but aren't worthy of a full blog.

## The entire set plus one more in the set

Let me start off where I started off<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup> lets say that someone who we shall name Steve anonymously puts a bounty on themselves which is described as "$1 in addition to whatever money Steve has on their person" how much money should be payed out to whoever collects the bounty on Steve and where would it come from? Well in this case the way that reality works and the set of actors involved constrains us to the answer of "whatever money Steve has on their person" and no more. This answer would correspond to addition being equivalent to the set union operator. That does work but with slightly different context it seems like the answer would be different, for example pretend that a god came down and said "I am going to transfer ten humans in addition to the entire human population to a habitable planet in a different galaxy". In this case specifying ten humans in addition implies that we're transferring more than just the entire human population but also ten humans that aren't a part of the entire human population because otherwise why specify those ten humans. The implementation of this would probably be that this god is presumably creating those humans out of thin air. This second case doesn't have a convenient mathematical equivalent and thinking about what a theorectical mathematical equivalent would be without having infinitely many humans hurts my brain a bit. I'm pretty sure this is a [type 5 paradox](https://youtu.be/ppX7Qjbe6BM?t=2035)

## Footnotes

<a href="./#1" name="1">1</a> - I started off in a fan-fic of the stormlight archive where a character I inserted into the story was putting up a bounty for themselves by promising "a shardblade in addition to any shardblades or shardplate $character has on them" rather than with money
