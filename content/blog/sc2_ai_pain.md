(intro building an ai in sc2 and why I'm interested in that)

(trying to set it up with lutris initially but rust-sc2 looking for the wrong binary location)

(trying to use an in dev version of rust-sc2 so wine would get handled correctly)

(trying finding out about the headless version)

(complaining about them doing ~/StarCraftII instead of /home/username/StarCraftII)

(what do I wanna do with Hassium now?)
