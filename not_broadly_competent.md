# Some people think I'm broadly competent

This is mostly an online phenomenon (it may be just one person) and I don't know where this comes from but it also seems to filter into how old they think I am (leading to an overestimation of somewhere between a couple and several years). Regardless this is false though I will clarify that in terms of math and programming I am relatively competent. I chose those words carefully to reduce the probability of my ego crucifying me, notably I consider relatively competent a low bar.

# Writing

Read these blog posts and tell me I'm competent at writing while keeping a straight face.

# Time management

Gotten better but still bad

# Presentations

simple advice

# Misc life things

Need to talk to people more, my diet sucks, I don't have a partner, I need to get better at not accidentally taking the lead in group work, I spend to much time watching youtube videos, I don't have an internship and no idea how to get one or how I should get a job. I have a bunch of stories I've come up with that I want to write down but I haven't written yet. I have no idea how to make a machine learning thing. I have multiple projects that I could maybe sell that I haven't even started yet.

# Conclusion

Scot why do you think I look competent if it's confidence please readjust your view of competence
